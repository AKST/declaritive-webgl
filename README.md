Declarive WebGl Render-er
=========================

The goal of this project is to write a declartive render-er that uses web gl,
for games or for user interfaces, in such that your logic can be represented
as pure function, not procedural code.

I don't really expect this to be the more performant way of rendering using
web gl, so this is more of a learning exercise.

## Building

```
yarn && yarn build
```

## Running

```
./scripts/start.bash
```

## Project Structure

ATM this is written more like an application, this is mostly for experimentation
purposes, however it'll be refactored in to a library once there is something
worth salvaging.
